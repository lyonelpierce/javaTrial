What did you like about Java? What didn't you like?
----------------------------------------------------------

I liked the fact that we have to state the type of the variable that we are declaring. Since I have experience in laravel and django, declaring the variables type was not hard at all.

What I dislike it is that is a compiler language so we have to wait to compile first, it takes too many time.


What would pursuing Java look like for you?
----------------------------------------------------------
Java is safer than other languages and has been around for a long time. I believe big companies require java developers for their projects because of security, and I think there is a big opportunity for developers. I definetly want to lear more about Java.
